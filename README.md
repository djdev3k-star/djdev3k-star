### üß† About Me

I‚Äôm a full-stack developer and strategic consultant who thrives at the intersection of code and operations. I design, build, and deploy tools that solve real problems‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs for small business teams, independent contractors, or educational initiatives. My work combines user-friendly interfaces with infrastructure that's secure, minimal, and built to last.

I‚Äôm especially interested in building systems that:
- Automate workflows for solo operators and small teams
- Reduce complexity through modular architecture
- Empower users through thoughtful UI/UX and backend logic
